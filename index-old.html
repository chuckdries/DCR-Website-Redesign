                    <p class="testText">We've been coming to DCRobotics since the beginning and can't say enough great things about it. The family based business started as a small club at the local community center and there is nothing else like this anywhere! Our children have made many long term friends and would be upset if we ever stopped coming. My son is a serious gamer and loves the gaming classes! My daughter assistant teaches the little children the robotics she learned at DCR, when she was younger. The owners encourage the older children to help the younger ones. You can sometimes see me volunteering in the office, giving a tour or helping on a field trip. My family and I love giving back to an organization that has given us so much! It's the least we can do!</p>

                    <p class="testText">My son is nuts about DCRobotics.  I can't believe how much he has changed, by just taking classes!  He was so shy when he started over a year ago, and hardly made eye contact with other children his age.  His confidence has grown by being part of this caring and supportive technology center.  He has found other people like him, finally!  The staff at DCR is definitely technically qualified, but best of all, they are caring.  They know all the children by their first names and treat them with respect.  The husband and wife team only hire the best people, and use their own children to help out.  Daytona has made a ton of friends there.  Lifelong ones.  He is having a Game Birthday Party there soon, and guess who he is inviting?  His friends from DCR (and of course a few other school friends)!  When he had a chance to join the robotics team at his school, he picked DCR's team instead.  He sits alone for a study period while his school friends take robotics at school.  That's real commitment!</p>

                    <p class="testText">Hi Diane, Just wanted to extend a thank you to you and your entire team for Preston’s 6th birthday party. He and his friends had such a great time and many of the kids are still talking about it! Since they are only 6, I was a little worried that the kids would get bored with the computers but that didn’t happen at all! They even enjoyed the scavenger hunt and virtual reality headsets. The young coaches were excellent and it was wonderful to see them relate to the little kids. I really appreciate that there were plenty of coaches available to offer as much assistance as needed. (One of the kids had never played Minecraft before but there was always a coach available to guide him).</p>

                    <p class="testText">We were also impressed with your facility and the whole operation. Your pride really shines through and it’s obvious you and your family are passionate about what you’re doing.</p>

                    <p class="testText">Thank you for coordinating all the details, decorations, favors, etc. It was really nice to just show up and enjoy the party! Thank you again for making it such a fun, stress-free and successful event!</p>
